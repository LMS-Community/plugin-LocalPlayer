# plugin-LocalPlayer
Local playback from your server computer using the Squeezelite software emulator.  This plugin uses Squeezelite to playback through the audio output of your server computer.  The player can be controlled from the server's web interface or other Squeezebox controller applications.

This plugin is written by Triode and is imported from his old repository on Google Code. After Google Code shut down its service Triode's plugins got a temporary home on http://triodeplugins.herger.net/ which has now been migrated to LMS-Community.
